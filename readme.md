## Development

### Locally

Before you start make sure you have *Ruby* and the gems for *Jekyll* installed locally. You can find out how to do that [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

1. `bundle install`
2. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:4000`

***Note:** You will need to re-run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to see changes made in `_config.yml`.*
