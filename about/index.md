Hi, My name is **Hassan Nadeem** and I'm an **Electrical Engineer** currently working in the Software Industry as an OS developer. My interests lie in the area of *System Software* that span topics of *Operating Systems*, *HW-SW & SW-SW interfaces* and *Computer Architecture*.

This is my personal website where I like to share my thoughts and technical ventures.
Any piece of code that I share on this website is my own, unrelated to clients that I work with.

Feel free to use any code published on this website as you please.
